Hi! This is a port of the inactive plugin to work on the Bukkit-1.1-R4 API

It was updated to use the new event system  so it would play nicely with 
everything.

I take no credit for the original code! All credit goes to Phiwa who can be 
contacted here : http://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/Phiwa/

I added some documentation and formatted the code for readability.

Feel free to browse the code but do not release this plugin without permission
of the original author! Thank you!

Dev notes:

Setup of project in eclipse:

1) First fork the repository if you plan on committing code follow the tutorial

2) File -> Import -> Git(Projects From Git) -> URI

3) Enter the fields as follows 
   URI: your git url
   host: github.com
   repository path: leave as is
   
   select ssh from drop down
   
   user: git
   
4) Click next, Import the existing project


Setup for remote upstream:
http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
Because the git plugin does not support upstream(as far as I know) this must be
done through the commandline

1) Open the command line( git bash for windows) and go to the project directory

2) Enter: git remote add upstream git://github.com/zephyrz4/bukkit-anti-addict-port.git
          git fetch upstream
          
To get latest updates from the upstream:

1) Enter: git fetch upstream
          git merge upstream/master
          
To get your code on to this repository


1) http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/


To get to the re-write branch in eclipse:

1) Make sure you followed the upstream instructions above.
2) Right click the project (AntiAddictPort...) and go to 'Team...' >'Switch to...' > New Branch...'
3) Click on the drop down menu and select "/refs/remote/upstream/rewrite"
4) Ensure that 'Merge' is the selected strategy, and the 'Checkout' box is indeed checked.

* we have added the rewrite branch in eclipse. to switch between the rewrite and the master: *

1) Right click your Project and navigate to 'Team...' > 'Switch to...' and select re-write.
   To change back, do the same thing, but select 'master' instead of 're-write'.
