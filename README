Rewrite of the old plugin

Dev notes:

Setup of project in eclipse:

1) First fork the repository if you plan on committing code follow the tutorial

2) File -> Import -> Git(Projects From Git) -> URI

3) Enter the fields as follows 
   URI: your git url
   host: github.com
   repository path: leave as is
   
   select ssh from drop down
   
   user: git
   
4) Click next, Import the existing project


Setup for remote upstream:
http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/
Because the git plugin does not support upstream(as far as I know) this must be
done through the commandline

1) Open the command line( git bash for windows) and go to the project directory

2) Enter: git remote add upstream git://github.com/zephyrz4/bukkit-anti-addict-port.git
          git fetch upstream
          
To get latest updates from the upstream:

1) Enter: git fetch upstream
          git merge upstream/master
          
To get your code on to this repository


1) http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/


To get to the re-write branch in eclipse:

1) Make sure you followed the upstream instructions above.
2) Right click the project (AntiAddictPort...) and go to 'Team...' >'Switch to...' > New Branch...'
3) Click on the drop down menu and select "/refs/remote/upstream/rewrite"
4) Ensure that 'Merge' is the selected strategy, and the 'Checkout' box is indeed checked.

* we have added the rewrite branch in eclipse. to switch between the rewrite and the master: *

1) Right click your Project and navigate to 'Team...' > 'Switch to...' and select re-write.
   To change back, do the same thing, but select 'master' instead of 're-write'.
